  "Personal Story

I’m Khalil Abd El-Majid, a Sudanese web developer and designer currently based in Egypt. My journey started with a strong background in Electrical Engineering at SUST, where I completed three semesters before the war disrupted my studies. Despite the challenges of displacement, I leaned into my passion for technology and creativity, turning my skills in web development into both a livelihood and a way to help others.

I’ve built a path that bridges resilience and innovation — from upgrading my own computers piece by piece, to designing and developing websites that empower businesses and educational platforms. Along the way, I’ve grown from someone who loved experimenting with tech into a professional who delivers results-driven digital solutions.

Mission

My mission is to create modern, accessible, and user-focused digital experiences that help businesses, organizations, and individuals bring their ideas to life online. I believe technology should feel effortless and empowering, not overwhelming.

At the same time, I want to use my skills and story to inspire others — especially young people from difficult circumstances — to see that creativity, persistence, and learning can open new doors no matter where you start.

# Audit Report: KamkmServe (Next.js 15, React 19, TS)

## Executive Summary
KamkmServe is a well-structured, modern Next.js app with solid foundations in security, observability, and data safety. It demonstrates good engineering discipline with environment validation, strong auth/role enforcement, secure headers, DB migration safety, and useful logging/testing utilities. Main risks are typical for early-stage projects: in-memory-only controls (rate limiting, cache), a few edge-runtime caveats, and uneven test coverage across API workflows.

Overall rating: Strong foundation (8.5/10) with clear, actionable improvements to reach production hardening.

---

## Strengths
- __Environment validation__: `src/env.js` uses `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` + `zod` with strict server/client schema and `emptyStringAsUndefined`.
- __Security headers__: `next.config.js` sets CSP, HSTS, XFO, XSS, referrer, etc. Sentry tunnel configured.
- __AuthZ in middleware__: `src/middleware.ts` enforces HTTPS, basic rate limiting, and admin path protection via Clerk + DB fallback for role lookup (edge-safe with neon-http).
- __DB safety__: ESLint drizzle rules enforce WHERE for update/delete. `scripts/check-migrations.mjs` blocks dangerous SQL unless annotated. Schema normalized with indexes (`drizzle/0000_*.sql`, `src/server/db/schema.ts`).
- __Observability__: Sentry integrated across client/server/edge; structured logging utility with prod JSON + dev human format (`src/lib/logger.ts`). DB layer wraps `execute()` for metrics/logging (`src/server/db/index.ts`).
- __Caching__: Uses Next `unstable_cache` with tags in `src/server/services.ts` for service queries. Simple TTL cache at `src/server/cache.ts` (easy to swap to Redis).
- __Testing__: Vitest configured with jsdom; meaningful tests for ABAC policies (`test/abac.test.ts`), logger (`test/logger.test.ts`), and upload validation (`test/uploads.test.ts`).
- __Project structure__: Clear App Router organization, separation of concerns in `src/`.

---

## Risks / Issues
- __In-memory rate limiting__: `src/middleware.ts` uses a global Map; not distributed, resets on instance recycle, and “best-effort” only.
- __Edge DB lookup in middleware__: On admin route without role claim, middleware calls Neon over edge to check role. This adds latency to navigation and introduces DB dependency in critical path for every admin request. Fail-closed to 403 on error can cause unexpected lockouts.
- __Basic Auth bypass option__: Optional basic auth allows bypassing Clerk for admin routes if envs set. Useful for break-glass, but risky if left enabled inadvertently or misconfigured.
- __Caching key for `getServiceById()`__: Cache key doesn’t include `id` in the keyspace (`["services:by-id"]` constant). Multiple IDs can collide in cache.
- __Uploads security__: Unit tests great, but runtime scanning integration is optional; no quota/abuse controls mentioned for upload endpoints.
- __Test coverage gaps__: Strong unit tests for core libs, but missing integration tests for API routes (orders/payouts/commissions); no e2e/regression suite.
- __TTL cache + rate limit store__: Both are in-memory per instance (`src/server/cache.ts`, rate limit store in middleware). Not HA under scale.
- __CSP maintenance__: Strong CSP in `next.config.js`, but image sources and third-party scripts can drift; no CSP validation test.
- __DB connection config__: `src/server/db/index.ts` runs `dotenv.config({ path: ".env" })`. With Next 15, serverless/edge contexts shouldn’t load dotenv at runtime; ensure only in Node serverless functions. Middleware correctly avoids importing it.

## Detailed Findings

### 1) Project Structure
- __Findings__: Clean `src/` modularization. App Router directories are organized by feature and marketing pages (`src/app/`).
- __Recommendation__: Add high-level architectural diagram to `README.md` and a “where to add features” guide.

### 2) Code Quality
- __Findings__: Good type safety, path aliases, linting rules (`eslint.config.js`), strict TS (`tsconfig.json`).
- __Recommendation__: Add stricter ESLint rules for security (e.g., `eslint-plugin-security`) and React accessibility checks beyond Next’s defaults.

### 3) Architecture & Design Patterns
- __Findings__: Server module boundaries are clear (`src/server/db`, `src/server/services.ts`). Logging and metrics cross-cut concerns implemented sanely.
- __Recommendation__: Introduce a service boundary diagram and transactional patterns doc (idempotency, retries) for money flows (orders/payouts).

### 4) Performance
- __Findings__: `unstable_cache` on services, DB operation timing logs, Sentry performance.
- __Recommendation__: Add per-route revalidation strategy doc. Use ISR where feasible. Consider edge caching for read-heavy pages. Add critical render measurements (CLS, LCP) in Sentry dashboards.

### 5) Security
- __Findings__: Strong headers, middleware role checks, ABAC library exists and is tested, migration guardrails.
- __Issues__:
  - In-memory rate limiting.
  - Optional admin basic auth bypass.
  - Edge DB lookup on admin path for every request.
- __Recommendations__:
  - Move rate limiting to Redis (Upstash) with bucket per IP + path, include headers `RateLimit-*`.
  - Gate “basic auth bypass” behind `NODE_ENV!=='production'` or explicit feature flag; log a prominent warning at startup if enabled.
  - Cache the admin role claim briefly at the edge via signed cookies or Clerk custom claims to avoid DB lookups on every request.

### 6) Documentation
- __Findings__: `README.md` thorough; `.env.example` comprehensive.
- __Recommendation__: Add runbooks for incidents, security review checklist, and a deployment safety checklist. Document DB fallback for roles in middleware.

### 7) Testing & Reliability
- __Findings__: Solid unit coverage for ABAC, logger, uploads.
- __Gaps__: No integration tests for `src/app/api/admin/*` and `uploads`.
- __Recommendation__: Add API contract tests (Vitest + supertest or Next test utilities). Add e2e smoke tests (Playwright) for critical flows: sign-in, add to cart, order submit, payout mark-paid.

### 8) UI/UX
- __Findings__: Marketing composition looks accessible (`skip to content`, semantic components).
- __Recommendation__: Add automated a11y tests (axe) in CI; ensure focus management and color contrast in dark mode.

### 9) Tooling/Dependencies/Build
- __Findings__: pnpm, Vitest, Prettier, Drizzle Kit; Vercel config present.
- __Recommendation__: Add Dependabot/Renovate. Add build cache hints and bundle analyzer for periodic review.

### 10) Scalability & Future-proofing
- __Findings__: Neon serverless + Drizzle scale well; logging structured.
- __Risks__: In-memory stores. Admin role DB check at edge.
- __Recommendation__: Centralize distributed caches/limits to Redis. Add job queue for long tasks (Inngest/Cloud Tasks/Queues). Introduce idempotency keys for payment/order endpoints.

## Concrete File-Level Notes

- __`src/middleware.ts`__:
  - Good: HTTPS redirect, in-memory rate limiting, admin route enforcement, fail-closed on role issues.
  - Improve:
    - Replace Map-based rate limit with Redis. Add real client IP derivation behind Vercel (`x-forwarded-for` is fine; also consider `x-vercel-proxied-for`).
    - Cache role check with short-lived tokenized claim or cookie to avoid DB per request.
    - Guard “Basic Auth bypass” with a prod kill switch and log via `logger.security(...)`.

- __`src/server/services.ts`__:
  - Bug: `getServiceById` cache key should include the `id`. Currently `["services:by-id"]` only.
  - Fix: Use key factory per id or pass the paramized key array.

- __`src/server/db/index.ts`__:
  - Good: Wraps `execute` for logging and metrics; avoids unsafe any; extracts sql text carefully.
  - Ensure: `dotenv` usage stays out of edge runtime; it’s fine for Node server functions.

- __`src/lib/logger.ts`__:
  - Good: Dev vs prod formats, request logging, perf and DB helpers.
  - Suggestion: Integrate Sentry breadcrumb/level mapping; redact known PII fields; include requestId propagation (middleware/route generate if absent).

- __`src/server/cache.ts`__:
  - Fine for dev. Document swap instructions to Redis; add interface compatibility with `getOrSet` to smooth migration.

- __Tests__:
  - ABAC: 14-policy set verified; solid scenario coverage (`test/abac.test.ts`).
  - Logger: format, env behavior, convenience methods (`test/logger.test.ts`).
  - Uploads: magic number checks, size, mime/ext, scan hooks (`test/uploads.test.ts`).
  - Add: API integration and e2e flows.

## Suggested Code Changes (small, targeted)

- __`src/server/services.ts`__: include id in cache key
  - Before: `["services:by-id"]`
  - After: `["services:by-id", id]`

- __`src/middleware.ts`__:
  - Add feature flag to disable Basic Auth in prod.
  - Switch rate limit store to Redis (configurable client); maintain headers `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-*`.
  - Cache positive admin role for a short time (e.g., signed cookie or Clerk custom claim refresh); add `logger.security` events when bypass or role failures occur.

I can prepare patches for these specific fixes when you’re ready.

## Next Steps
- Choose from the prioritized list; I recommend we:
  1) Patch `getServiceById` cache key.  
  2) Add a prod guard for Basic Auth bypass.  
  3) Plan Redis-based rate limiting (wiring + config).  
  4) Add a minimal integration test for one admin route to set the pattern.

Summary: I reviewed key runtime files (`src/middleware.ts`, `src/env.js`, `src/server/db/*`, `src/server/services.ts`, `src/lib/logger.ts`) and tests (`test/*`). The project is in strong shape with clear, tactical improvements to reach production-grade robustness.

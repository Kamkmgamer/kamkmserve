# KamkmServe — Software Project Audit Report (2025-08-24)

## Executive Summary
KamkmServe is a Next.js 15 (App Router) application for selling services with admin CMS, Clerk authentication, Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL), and Sentry monitoring. The project demonstrates strong engineering practices: strict TypeScript, robust CI with unit/axe/e2e tests, hardened security headers and middleware, rate limiting, and environment validation via `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`. Documentation is unusually thorough.

Key risks are limited and mostly operational: a few env vars used in security-critical paths are not validated in the canonical schema, CSP still allows `'unsafe-inline'` in styles, and middleware role lookups rely on Neon’s HTTP driver assumptions. Coverage reporting, dependency security gating, and observability dashboards are not yet codified. Overall, the codebase is in a good to very good state and ready for iterative hardening.

Overall rating: 8.5/10.

## Strengths
- __Modern stack and structure__: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind 4, Drizzle ORM, Clerk, Sentry. Clear layout in `src/app/`, `src/server/`, `src/components/`. See `README.md` “Project Structure”.
- __Security headers & caching__: Strong CSP/HSTS/XFO/nosniff/referrer policy and route-level caching in `next.config.js`, including immutable caches for build assets and s-maxage for marketing routes.
- __Middleware hardening__: `src/middleware.ts` enforces HTTPS, applies Upstash-based or in-memory rate limiting, optional basic auth for admin in dev, robust ADMIN/SUPERADMIN role checks with short-lived HMAC-signed role cookie cache.
- __Env validation__: Single source via `src/env.js` with `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`, integrated in `next.config.js`. Clear docs in `README.md`.
- __Testing & CI__: Vitest setup (`vitest.config.ts`) with accessibility tests, Playwright e2e in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), bundle budgets check (`scripts/check-budgets.mjs`).
- __Observability__: Sentry integrated across client (`instrumentation-client.ts`), server and edge (`sentry.*.config.ts`) with conservative prod sampling and ad-blocker tunnel in `next.config.js`.
- __Documentation__: Excellent `README.md`, production hardening `ToDo.md`, and deep `docs/` (security, deployment, observability, testing).

---

## Weaknesses
- __Env schema gaps__: Security-relevant vars used but not validated in `src/env.js`:
  - `ROLE_CACHE_SECRET`, `ROLE_CACHE_TTL_SEC` for HMAC role cookie in `src/middleware.ts`.
  - `ADMIN_BASIC_USER`, `ADMIN_BASIC_PASS`, `ADMIN_BASIC_BYPASS_ENABLED`.
- __CSP style policy__: `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` in `next.config.js`. Inline styles still allowed, increasing XSS surface.
- __Middleware DB lookup coupling__: Admin role DB lookup in edge middleware uses Neon HTTP (`@neondatabase/serverless`) directly. If `DATABASE_URL` is not Neon HTTP-compatible, this will fail. No fallback path is documented.
- __Sentry org/project hardcoded__: `next.config.js` embeds `org` and `project`, which is less portable between environments/organizations.
- __Security headers coverage__: Missing useful modern headers:
  - `Permissions-Policy` (formerly Feature-Policy)
  - `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` (COOP) / `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` (COEP) where applicable
- __AuthZ assertions in API handlers__: `README.md` states routes should verify roles, but the audit didn’t verify every handler under `src/app/api/admin/*`. Risk of drift without centralized guard helpers/tests.
- __Testing coverage visibility__: No coverage thresholds/reporting configured for Vitest; CI does not publish coverage artifact or gate by thresholds.
- __Dependency vulnerability policy__: `ToDo.md` notes intent, but CI does not enforce failing on high/critical vulns after review.
- __Terraform not fully wired__: `infra/terraform/` lacks backend config and is noted as WIP in `ToDo.md`.
- __Seed data hosting__: `drizzle/seed.ts` uses public ImageKit URLs; if used in prod, ensure those assets are controlled and immutable.

## Detailed Findings

### Project Structure and Organization
- __Good__: Clear separation of concerns. Key entry points called out in `README.md` (e.g., `src/middleware.ts`, `src/server/`, `src/app/`).
- __Opportunity__: Add index-level “barrel” modules for `src/server/` services/utilities to standardize imports and decouple route handlers from DB details.

### Code Quality
- __TypeScript strictness__: `tsconfig.json` uses `"strict": true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `isolatedModules`, etc. Great.
- __ESLint__: Flat config with `typescript-eslint` and `eslint-plugin-drizzle` rules enforcing safe `update/delete` with `where` in `eslint.config.js`.
- __Consistency__: Uses path aliases `@`/`~`. Prettier integrated.

### Architecture and Design Patterns
- __Edge-first middleware__: Optimized with dynamic imports for Upstash/Neon to reduce cold-start costs (`src/middleware.ts`).
- __Role caching__: HMAC-signed role cache cookie reduces DB lookups while keeping TTL short. Good pattern.
- __Potential coupling__: Middleware DB lookup path assumes Neon HTTP client; consider abstraction to swap providers.

### Performance
- __Caching headers__: Strong asset caching and s-maxage on marketing routes in `next.config.js`.
- __Bundle analysis__: `@next/bundle-analyzer` wired, toggled by `ANALYZE`.
- __Runtime instrumentation__: Sentry tracing limited in prod; `instrumentation-client.ts` captures vitals and caps replay.
- __Opportunity__: Add route segment `revalidate`/`dynamic = 'force-static'` where applicable to unlock more ISR/edge cache, and confirm that expensive admin pages are dynamic only.

### Security
- __Headers__: CSP, HSTS (1 year + preload), XFO: DENY, nosniff, referrer-policy set globally in `next.config.js`.
- __Rate limiting__: Per-IP sliding window for APIs; headers propagated (`RateLimit-*`, `Retry-After`).
- __AuthZ__: Middleware enforces ADMIN/SUPERADMIN on `/admin` and `/api/admin/*`. Optional basic auth in non-prod.
- __Gaps__:
  - Env schema missing for `ROLE_CACHE_SECRET`, `ADMIN_BASIC_*`, `ROLE_CACHE_TTL_SEC`.
  - CSP `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` remains.
  - No `Permissions-Policy`, `COOP/COEP` where those make sense.
  - Middleware DB lookup depends on `DATABASE_URL` being Neon HTTP-compatible.

### Documentation and Comments
- __Excellent__: `README.md`, `ToDo.md`, `docs/` are detailed and actionable.
- __Opportunity__: Add a short SECURITY.md pointing to key protections and a quick checklist for releases.

### Testing and Reliability
- __Vitest__: Unit tests, accessibility tests using `jest-axe` via `vitest` adapters (`test/`).
- __E2E__: Playwright `tests/e2e/` with CI that boots `pnpm preview` and waits-on server before running tests.
- __Opportunity__: Add coverage reporting with minimum thresholds; publish artifacts in CI.

### UI/UX Quality
- __Tailwind 4__: Modern styling foundation. Image patterns configured for `ik.imagekit.io` in `next.config.js`.
- __Accessibility__: Dedicated a11y test job demonstrates good attention here.
- __Opportunity__: Consider Storybook for component-level testing and visual regression (Chromatic) for admin UI.

### Tooling, Dependencies, Build
- __Dependencies__: Modern versions (Next 15.2.3, React 19, TypeScript 5.8).
- __Lockfile__: `pnpm-lock.yaml` present; CI uses `--frozen-lockfile`.
- __CI__: Lint, typecheck, unit + a11y tests, Playwright e2e, budgets, and deploy job to Vercel with prebuilt artifacts.
- __Opportunity__: Add renovate config (Dependabot exists in `.github/dependabot.yml`—good); enforce vulnerability policy.

### Scalability and Future-Proofing
- __Serverless-friendly__: Upstash rate limiting; Sentry; Neon serverless HTTP client.
- __IaC__: Terraform folder exists but not production-ready yet.
- __Opportunity__: Document multi-region patterns (already in `ToDo.md`), connection pool expectations with Neon, and read replicas roadmap.

## Recommendations (Prioritized)

### High Impact / Low Effort
- __Validate all security-relevant env vars__ in `src/env.js`:
  - Add `ROLE_CACHE_SECRET`, `ROLE_CACHE_TTL_SEC`, `ADMIN_BASIC_USER`, `ADMIN_BASIC_PASS`, `ADMIN_BASIC_BYPASS_ENABLED` with appropriate `zod` schemas and include in `runtimeEnv`.
  - Update `.env.example` and `README.md`.
- __Tighten CSP styles__ in `next.config.js`:
  - Remove `'unsafe-inline'` from `style-src` if feasible, or replace with hashed/nonced styles where needed.
  - Audit inline styles; prefer Tailwind classes and external CSS.
- __Sentry config portability__:
  - Move `org`/`project` in `withSentryConfig` to env variables consumed in `next.config.js`, or document per-environment overrides in CI.

### High Impact / Medium Effort
- __Middleware DB lookup robustness__:
  - Guard the Neon HTTP path: if `DATABASE_URL` is not Neon HTTP-compatible, use a server-side verification endpoint (API route) or alternate driver.
  - Document provider assumptions in `README.md` and `docs/deployment/`.
- __Add modern security headers__ in `next.config.js` headers:
  - `Permissions-Policy`: e.g., `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`.
  - Consider `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` for pages that benefit (evaluate compatibility).
- __Centralize API authz__:
  - Create helper utilities in `src/server/authz.ts` to assert role on every mutating admin route, and import consistently.
  - Add tests to assert 401/403 coverage across `src/app/api/admin/*`.

### Medium Impact / Low Effort
- __Test coverage reporting__:
  - Enable Vitest coverage (c8), publish report artifact in CI, and add minimum thresholds to prevent regressions.
- __Dependency security policy__:
  - Add a CI step (e.g., `pnpm audit` or `oss-index`) to fail on high/critical vulns or require approval.
- __Docs__:
  - Add `SECURITY.md` summarizing headers, rate limiting, authz patterns, and incident contact.

### Medium Impact / Medium Effort
- __Performance config review__:
  - Annotate route segments with `dynamic`/`revalidate` for ISR vs. dynamic behavior as appropriate.
  - Consider Next’s `fetch` cache and `stale-while-revalidate` for data loaders in non-admin routes.
- __Observability dashboards__:
  - Implement dashboards/alerts for LCP/CLS/API latency (Grafana or Sentry Performance) per `ToDo.md`.

### Backlog
- __Terraform backend & minimal prod resources__:
  - Configure remote backend, state locking, and secrets policy. Tie into Vercel/Neon/Upstash resources.

## Overall Rating
Score: 8.5/10

- __Why__: Strong baseline across security, testing, CI/CD, and documentation. The main gaps are incremental hardening items (env schema completeness, CSP styles, header set, DB lookup assumptions in middleware) and maturity concerns (coverage gating, dependency policy, IaC readiness). These are fixable without major refactors.
